A MATLAB-based Educational Bridge Between Theory and Practice in Robotics.

ps (mcarbonera).:
-> This fork has the intent to add a controller that implements the navigation task
with a Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System. 

-> This work will be the practical part of my graduation thesis in Mobile Robotics. 
In this work I'll explore behavior arbitration (with hybrid system) and behavior fusion
(with Fuzzy Inference System).

-> I'm using a different robot that I named Jubileu. The class "Jubileu.m" is inside the
folder "robot". The supervisor is inside folder "controller/jubileu", with the name "JSupervisor.m".
